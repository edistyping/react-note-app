# Note Taking App using React! 


1. Do not use Database... Instead use LocalStorage for saving contents. 

Q. How to get inputs? Is there a library(?)
    - ctrl + v 
    - picture included 
    - 
Q. How to store notes including category to localstorage when it's only key-value? Can the value be an object?  

Q. How should the data be passed around? 


Hi
1. Search Bar for subject and content
2. Add a new Note

Note: Subject, Content, Category, Date
- Edit, Delete, Hide button
